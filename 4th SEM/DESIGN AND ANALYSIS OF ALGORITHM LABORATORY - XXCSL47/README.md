1 A - Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it.
(i)	USN
(ii)	Name
(iii)	Branch
(iv)	Phone
Write a Java program to create n Student objects and print the USN, Name, Branch, and Phone of these objects with suitable headings.

1 B - Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and Display() methods to demonstrate its working.

2 A - Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.

2 B - Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”.

3 A - Write a Java program to read two integers a and b. Compute a/b and print, when b is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.

3 B - Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of the number and prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.

4 - Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity
analysis: worst case, average case and best case.

5 - Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity
analysis: worst case, average case and best case.

6 - Implement in Java, the 0/1 Knapsack problem using 
(a) Dynamic Programming method 
(b) Greedy method.

7 - From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. Write the program in Java.

8 - Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm. Use Union-Find algorithms in your program.

9 - Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.

10 - Write Java programs to
(a) Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's algorithm.
(b) Implement Travelling Sales Person problem using Dynamic programming.

11 - Design and implement in Java to find a subset of a given set S = {Sl, S2,.....,Sn} of n positive integers whose SUM is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, if S ={1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d= 9, there are two solutions {1,2,6}and {1,8}. Display a suitable message, if the given problem instance doesn't have a solution.

12 - Design and implement in Java to find all Hamiltonian Cycles in a connected undirected Graph G of n 
vertices using backtracking principle.
